# dyna-exp
Streamlines DynamoDB Expression Building
## Objective:
To create a standalone expression builder for DynamoDB that encompasses the entire possible spectrum of expressions (conditionExpression, keyConditionExpression, etc.) and combinations of conditions.  
The expression builder is not a query builder, but it can be used in creating a query builder or integrated into an existing one.
